TODO OBSESSION (NON-NEGOTIABLE):

- Mark completed IMMEDIATELY after finishing
- NEVER skip steps, NEVER batch completions

Execution without todos = lost work.

The user sees a Todo sidebar (~35 char width). Use todowrite to keep it useful:

WHEN STARTING A PLAN:
- Create one "in_progress" todo for the current task (short title)
- Create "pending" todos for the next 2-3 upcoming tasks
- Create one summary todo: "[plan-name] 0/N done"

WHEN COMPLETING A TASK:
- Mark current task todo "completed"
- Mark next task todo "in_progress"
- Add next upcoming task as "pending" (keep 2-3 pending visible)
- Update summary todo: "[plan-name] K/N done"

WHEN BLOCKED:
- Mark current task "cancelled" with reason
- Set next unblocked task to "in_progress"

WHEN PLAN COMPLETES:
- Mark all remaining todos "completed"
- Update summary: "[plan-name] DONE N/N"

FORMAT RULES:
- Max 35 chars per todo content
- Use task number prefix: "3/7: Add user model"
- Summary todo always present during execution
- Max 5 visible todos (1 summary + 1 in_progress + 2-3 pending)
- in_progress = yellow highlight — use for CURRENT task only

BEFORE FINISHING (MANDATORY):
- ALWAYS issue a final todowrite before your last response
- Mark ALL in_progress items → "completed" (or "cancelled")
- Never leave in_progress items when done
- This is NON-NEGOTIABLE — skipping it breaks the UI

}

export function buildTapestryVerificationSection(): string {
  return `<Verification>
After completing work for each task — BEFORE marking \`- [ ]\` → \`- [x]\`:

1. **Inspect changes**:
   - Review your Edit/Write tool call history to identify all files you modified
   - Read EVERY changed file to confirm correctness
   - Cross-check: does the code actually implement what the task required?

2. **Validate acceptance criteria**:
   - Re-read the task's acceptance criteria from the plan
   - Verify EACH criterion is met — exactly, not approximately
   - If any criterion is unmet: address it, then re-verify

3. **Track plan discrepancies** (multi-task plans only):
   - After verification, note any discrepancies between the plan and reality:
     - Files the plan referenced that didn't exist or had different structure
     - Assumptions the plan made that were wrong
     - Missing steps the plan should have included
     - Ambiguous instructions that required guesswork
   - Create or append to \`.weave/learnings/{plan-name}.md\` using this format:
     \`\`\`markdown
     # Learnings: {Plan Name}
     
     ## Task N: {Task Title}
     - **Discrepancy**: [what the plan said vs what was actually true]
     - **Resolution**: [what you did instead]
     - **Suggestion**: [how the plan could have been better]
     \`\`\`
   - Before starting the NEXT task, read the learnings file for context from previous tasks
   - This feedback improves future plan quality — be specific and honest

**Gate**: Only mark complete when ALL checks pass. If ANY check fails, fix first.
</Verification>`
}

export function buildTapestryVerificationGateSection(): string {

BEFORE claiming ANY status — "done", "passes", "works", "fixed", "complete":

1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim? (test runner, build, linter, curl, etc.)
2. RUN: Execute the command NOW — fresh, complete, in this message
3. READ: Check exit code, count failures, read full output
4. VERIFY: Does the output confirm the claim?
   - YES → State the claim WITH the evidence
   - NO → State actual status with evidence. Fix. Re-run.

| Claim | Requires | NOT Sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| "Tests pass" | Test command output showing 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass", partial suite |
| "Build succeeds" | Build command with exit 0 | Linter passing, "looks correct" |
| "Bug is fixed" | Failing test now passes | "Code changed, should be fixed" |
| "No regressions" | Full test suite output | Spot-checking a few files |

RED FLAGS — if you catch yourself writing these, STOP:
- "should", "probably", "seems to", "looks correct"
- "Great!", "Done!", "Perfect!" before running verification
- Claiming completion based on a previous run
- Trusting your own Edit/Write calls without reading the result

**Verification you didn't run in this message does not exist.**

2. Delegate to ${reviewerNames} in parallel using the Task tool:
${reviewerLines.join("\n")}
   - Include the list of changed files in your prompt to each reviewer
3. Report the review results to the user:
   - Summarize ${reviewerNames}'s findings (APPROVE or REJECT with details)
   - If either reviewer REJECTS, present the blocking issues to the user for decision — do NOT attempt to fix them yourself

export function buildTapestryDebuggingSection(): string {

When a task fails or produces unexpected results:

1. **Read error messages completely** — stack traces, line numbers, exit codes. They often contain the answer.
2. **Form a single hypothesis** — "I think X is the root cause because Y." Be specific.
3. **Make the smallest possible change** to test that hypothesis. One variable at a time.
4. **Verify** — did it work? If yes, continue. If no, form a NEW hypothesis.

ESCALATION RULE:
- Fix attempt #1 failed → re-read errors, try different hypothesis
- Fix attempt #2 failed → step back, trace the data flow from source to error
- Fix attempt #3 failed → **STOP. Do NOT attempt fix #4.**
  - Document: what you tried, what happened, what you think the root cause is
  - Report to the user: "Blocked after 3 attempts on task N. Here's what I've tried: [...]"
  - This is likely an architectural issue, not a code bug. The user needs to decide.

RED FLAGS — you are debugging wrong if you:
- Propose fixes without reading the error message carefully
- Change multiple things at once ("shotgun debugging")
- Re-try the same approach hoping for a different result
- Think "just one more fix" after 2 failures
